# password-generator
Building a password generator using REACT

Create an app to generate random password.


 User can enter the length of password, and click on generate button. Display

generated password in a div. Password can contain all alphabets.



Include checkboxes for user to select following options:

1. Include alphabets

2. Include numbers

3.Add extra checkbox for including special characters


# Assumption:
Password Length: Users will input a positive integer for the password length.

Default Behavior: If no checkbox is selected, only alphabets are included.

Checkbox Options:
1.	Include Alphabets: Checked by default.
2.	Include Numbers: Adds numeric characters (0–9).
3.	Include Special Characters: Adds predefined special characters (!@#$%^&*()).
Error Handling: Input validation ensures password length is valid and at least one checkbox is selected.
Temporary Hosting: The app will be hosted on a platform Netlify.
Host On Netlify:
	Build the App: npm run build
	Drag and drop the build folder to the Netlify’s site:
